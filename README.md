# Univesity-of-Delaware-Analyst-Final-Round-Interivew-Project

In this module, I visualized academic tuition & fees from 2016-2019. More information can be found in the project description file in this repo, and [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/dfr/2020/ReportHTML.aspx?unitId=130943). In addition, I implemented regression models such as random forest, gradient boosting, and linear regression to observe how well they predict the unseen future data.
